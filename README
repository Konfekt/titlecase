NAME
    Lingua::EN::TitleCaps - Automatically title-case headlines and
    title-texts.

SYNOPSIS
            # OO usage
            use Lingua::EN::TitleCaps;

            my $tc = Lingua::EN::TitleCaps->new();
            print $tc->titlecase('Small word at end is nothing to be afraid of');
                    # prints 'Small Word at End Is Nothing to Be Afraid Of'

            # Non-OO usage
            use Lingua::EN::TitleCaps qw/titlecase/;
        
            print titlecase('IF IT’S ALL CAPS, FIX IT');
                    # prints 'If It’s All Caps, Fix It'

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple method for automatically title-case texts
    (generally headings and title texts) according to traditional editorial
    rules (it uses guidelines from "The New York Times Manual of Style").

    While a module that provides such functionality already exists
    (Lingua::EN::Titlecase), this module is much lighter weight and provides
    a much simpler API, you are encouraged to check Lingua::EN::Titlecase
    out and see which one is better for your needs.

    It should be noted that this module expects your input to be UTF-8, and
    you can rest assured your special UTF-8 characters will remain intact.

    This module is a CPANization of Aristotle Pagaltzis's fork of John
    Gruber's Title Case script (see AUTHORS for links to original source
    code).

METHODS
  new()
    Creates a new instance of this module.

  titlecase( $text )
    Returns a properly title-cased version of the provided text.

AUTHORS
    Aristotle Pagaltzis (<http://plasmasturm.org/code/titlecase/>), based on
    work by John Gruber (<http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case>).

    Made into a CPAN distribution by Ido Perlmuter, "<ido at ido50.net>"
